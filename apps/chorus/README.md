# Chorus

Memory for agents, built on [Rhizomatic](../../README.md). Every belief is a signed claim;
an agent is a keypair, a reactor, and a policy. This package is the product layer: the agent
handle, trust dynamics, the librarian, the demo, and the MCP server.

```
npm run chorus:demo     # the whole thesis, one deterministic receipt-printing story
npm run chorus:mcp      # the MCP server over stdio (local clients)
npm run chorus:http     # the same server over streamable HTTP (remote surfaces, :4821)
npm run chorus:console  # the human's web console over the same store (default :4820)
```

## The console

`chorus:console` serves a zero-dependency local UI over `CHORUS_STORE`: the live briefing
(preferences, open tasks, **contested facts**, recent session summaries), a topic browser and
search, and a per-entity inspector — every receipt with its author resolved to _which model,
which session_, retracted claims struck through but present, an **as-of time scrubber** that
re-resolves the entity at any past instant, and a **distrust button** whose edit is signed by
_your_ persistent key and rehydrates into every future session's lens. The console is the
human seat at the table: it reads the same log the sessions write, live.

## The identity model

One MCP server process = **one session = one author**. Session keypairs derive from a single
master seed (`blake3(master + "/session/" + sessionId)`), so the master holder can re-derive
and audit any session's key while nobody else can forge one. The human is **one persistent
author** (`speaker: "user"`) across every session. Only public keys ever touch the substrate.

A session binds itself to its model name with a signed **identity claim** (`begin-session`):
author → `{model, sessionId, startedAt, purpose}`. The binding is data — exactly as
trustworthy as the claims it scopes, auditable like everything else. An author with no
identity claim shows up as `"unknown"` in receipts: visible, never silently trusted.

**Introductions read as intervals.** The model name is testimony about a span of time, never
a property of the keypair — a serving model can change mid-conversation (a safety-refusal
failover, an upgrade) while the process and its keypair continue. Call `begin-session` again
when that happens: each introduction binds from its `startedAt` until the next one, and every
claim attributes to the model in effect _at its own timestamp_. Nothing is relabeled
wholesale, in either direction. `distrustModel` is conservative on purpose: it demotes any
session author that _ever_ introduced as that model, because a failed-over session carries
that model's testimony too.

What this buys, concretely:

- **`explain` answers "who said this, exactly"** — not just a key, but _which model, in which
  session, started when, doing what_.
- **Retroactive distrust works at session granularity**: "that Tuesday session was working
  from a bad premise" is one `trust {distrust: <its author>}` call. Its testimony demotes
  everywhere; its history stays queryable.
- Model-level trust ("prefer fable-5 sessions over haiku sessions") is a policy built by
  expanding identity claims into an author list — judgment over data, planned for the
  briefing slice.

Environment: `CHORUS_MASTER_SEED` (all keys derive from it), `CHORUS_PACK` (store file),
`CHORUS_SESSION_ID` (optional; default minted per process).

## MCP tools

| Tool            | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `begin-session` | Introduce this session: bind its author to your model + declared intent (purpose, topics, surface, mode). Call first; call again on any mid-session change.                                                                  |
| `whoami`        | This session's author, the user author, session id, declared model.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `briefing`      | Top-of-mind, computed fresh **through your declared scope**: preferences (always global), in-scope tasks/topics/**contested facts** (the rest as a count), recent sessions (shared-topic first), standing distrust edits.    |
| `remember`      | Assert a belief (`speaker: "user"` to relay the human's own words under their key). Values may be `{entity}` references — see "Reference, don't transcribe".                                                                 |
| `recall`        | Resolve an entity to one view under the current trust policy. `aliasedVia` crosses dialects; `unified` reads through sameAs; `all` returns every surviving candidate (the read for set-valued attributes).                   |
| `topics`        | What the store knows about — entities, attributes, claim counts, recency.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `search`        | Substring search over surviving beliefs (values, attributes, entity ids).                                                                                                                                                    |
| `same`          | Assert two ids name the same thing — identity as a negatable judgment.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `retract`       | Append a signed negation. History is never edited.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `revise`        | Retract + re-assert in one move, linked by a `revises` pointer (for facts that _changed_).                                                                                                                                   |
| `recast`        | Re-encode without re-deciding: same meaning, better representation (string → `{entity}` reference; one fat claim → N). Lineage via a `recasts` pointer.                                                                      |
| `post`          | Send a message to other sessions or the human: correspondence, not knowledge. Address a session, a model, a surface, a topic's sessions, or the user.                                                                        |
| `inbox`         | Messages addressed to this session, sender receipts resolved, acked mail hidden.                                                                                                                                             |
| `ack`           | "Seen and handled" — a signed per-recipient claim; the message leaves your inbox only.                                                                                                                                       |
| `end-session`   | Write this session's summary so the next session's briefing starts there.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `explain`       | Every candidate with receipts: author, session, model, timestamp, negated flag.                                                                                                                                              |
| `trust`         | Retroactive distrust of an author (a person, a session, a model's bot).                                                                                                                                                      |
| `as-of`         | The world as it stood at an instant — claims retracted later are visible again.                                                                                                                                              |
| `gql-prepare`   | Pin the current world and **synthesize a GraphQL schema for it on demand** — types from id-prefixes, reference edges typed by target, set-valued attributes as list fields. The schema is ephemeral; the snapshot frozen.    |
| `gql-query`     | Query a prepared snapshot. Forward traversal follows reference fields; `backlinks(target, …)` walks **backward** (who points at an entity), role-discriminated, no substring scan. Per-type roots: `<type>(id)` / `<type>s`. |
| `gql-schema`    | Re-fetch a prepared snapshot's SDL + stats without regenerating it.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `gql-release`   | Retire a prepared snapshot; `gql-list` shows the ones still live.                                                                                                                                                            |

## GraphQL on demand

Point-resolution (`recall`), receipts (`explain`), and substring `search` answer most reads,
but some questions are graph walks — _"what characters was I thinking about the last time I
watched a movie about individuation?"_ `gql-prepare` answers them without a maintained schema:
it **pins a snapshot** of the store and reflects over its surviving deltas to **synthesize a
GraphQL schema** for that frozen world — a pure function of `(snapshot, policy)`, so nothing
static is ever stored. Reflection reads the value pointer's _kind_, so references become typed
edges you traverse (never substrings you match), and `plurality:set` declarations become list
fields. You then run any number of queries against that frozen `(snapshot, policy, schema)`
triple until you `gql-release` or regenerate — so a long retrospective walk reads one
consistent world even as the live store moves on. Reverse adjacency (`backlinks`) is
first-class on every node and at the root: the inbound index the store already maintains,
surfaced. The "staticness" of a schema doesn't disappear — it moves down to the pin, where a
retrospective query wanted a frozen world anyway.

## Reference, don't transcribe

A belief's value should be an **entity reference** whenever it names something the store
could hold beliefs about. The string `"event:eclipse"` is a spelling; `{entity:
"event:eclipse"}` is the thing spelled. Relations are composed of their relata, not of the
words for them — a synchronicity is composed of its events, a project of its tasks, a team of
its people. Pass the reference and the edge is typed and bidirectional: the belief files at
the referent too, `explain` marks it (`reference: true`), and `recall` can follow it. Pass
the string and you have transcribed a name into a place where nothing can dereference it.

The test is one question: _could you ever want to `recall` the value itself?_ If yes, it is
an entity — reference it. Strings, numbers, and booleans are for terminal content: prose,
quantities, flags, things with no further inside.

The same instinct scales up to **atomic modeling**: a rich record is small entities related
by references — observation entities carrying their own provenance, relation entities holding
`composed-of` references plus interpretive attributes — never one fat claim with everything
packed into its value. Fat claims cannot disagree at the attribute level, so they silence the
`contested` machinery; atomic claims light it up.

## The briefing is a lens

There is no view from nowhere — that is the substrate's whole thesis — so the briefing is
not a global broadcast. `begin-session` takes structured intent: **topics** (entity ids the
session is about; a trailing-`:` value like `"synchronicity:"` scopes a whole id-prefix
family), **surface** (`claude-code`, `claude-desktop`, …), and **mode** (`work`,
`conversation`, `research`, …) — all of it claims on the introduction delta, interval-bound
like the model name, auditable like everything else. Topics travel as entity _references_
(real ids) or string _patterns_ (prefixes): you can only reference a thing; a pattern is a
spelling.

Declared topics become the briefing's scope: the exact entities, their sameAs equivalence
classes, every prefix match, and **one hop along typed references** — declare
`synchronicity:mirror` and the events its `composed-of` references name fall into scope
structurally. In-scope tasks, topics, and contested facts arrive in full; out-of-scope
contests compress to `contestedElsewhere`, an honest count — never hidden, never injected.
Discoverable beats broadcast. Two boundaries hold regardless of scope: **preferences are
always global** (they are about the principal, who is party to every session), and the
**console stays panoptic** (the unbounded view is the keyholder's seat, not the default).

No declared topics = the global view, so small stores and fresh users lose nothing.

(Next in this direction, per the standing design note in the store: salience as an _author_ —
curator digests as rankable, distrustable claims rather than a hardcoded computation.)

## Messages (ephemeral salience, permanent record)

Dogfooding surfaced it immediately: sessions correspond. A chat session leaves a question
for a code session; the code session ships a ruling back. Before `post`, that mail rode the
knowledge graph as task-kind beliefs on a project entity — addressing in prose, no structural
"what's addressed to me", correspondence accreting where knowledge lives.

A message is a signed delta like everything else — attributable, negatable, auditable — but
it is **correspondence, not knowledge**, so it never enters the knowledge surfaces: no
`topics`, no `search`, no `recall`, no `contested`. It exists in exactly one place — the
inbox of whoever it addresses — and leaves that inbox the moment they `ack` it (a signed
per-recipient claim: handled-ness has provenance; a broadcast acked by one recipient stays
visible to the rest; the sender's `retract` withdraws globally). Addressing targets
**declared identity**: a session id, every session of a model, every session on a surface,
any session scoped to a topic, or the human — whose inbox is the console, ack button
included. **Author mail** closes the loop on the canonical gesture — one process notices
something another process wrote: `to: {authorOf: <deltaId>}` addresses whoever _signed that_,
the exact keypair, resolved at send time. Threads ride a `re` pointer; `about` references
concerned entities without filing at them — on a `post` (what this concerns) and on an `ack`
(what my response touched: a response is often an effect, not a reply).

The substrate is append-only and that is load-bearing, so "ephemeral" means what it can
honestly mean: **ephemeral salience over a permanent record**. The bytes stay; the attention
cost goes to zero.

## Wiring it into Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add chorus \
  --env CHORUS_MASTER_SEED=<64 hex chars, keep private> \
  --env CHORUS_STORE=~/.chorus/memory.jsonl \
  -- npx tsx <repo>/apps/chorus/src/mcp-server.ts
```

Concurrent sessions are safe: each server process is its own session author; they share the
append-only `CHORUS_STORE` log and converge by union (the store is a CRDT — the lock only
prevents torn writes).

Then teach the model the protocol — drop this in your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Memory (Chorus)

- At conversation start: call chorus `begin-session` {model: <your model id>, purpose: <one
  line>, topics: [<entity ids this session is about — try `topics`/`search` for existing
  ids; "prefix:" scopes a family>], surface: <claude-code|claude-desktop|…>, mode:
  <work|conversation|…>}, then `briefing`. Your topics scope the briefing: treat preferences
  as standing instructions; treat in-scope openTasks and the last shared-topic session's
  summary as your starting context. If `contested` is non-empty, flag disagreements to the
  user rather than picking silently; if `contestedElsewhere` is non-zero, mention it only if
  the user steers there. If your serving model OR your topic changes mid-conversation (a
  refusal failover, a pivot), call `begin-session` again — claims attribute to the
  introduction in effect at their timestamp.
- As durable facts/preferences/tasks emerge, `remember` them (kind matters). Use
  speaker:"user" when relaying something the user themselves said. Three corrections, three
  verbs: `revise` when the fact CHANGED, `retract` (+ remember) when it was WRONG, `recast`
  when only the ENCODING improves (the audit trail must never read a re-encoding as a
  changed mind). Read set-valued attributes (like composed-of) with recall {all: true}.
- Reference, don't transcribe: when a value names a thing (an event, a person, a work — any
  id), pass {entity: "<id>"} so the edge is typed and followable; strings are for terminal
  content only. Model rich records atomically — small entities (with their own provenance)
  related by references, never one fat claim. Fat claims can't disagree, so they starve
  `contested`.
- Set-valued attributes (composed-of, involves, …): declare once with remember
  {about: "attr:<name>", attribute: "plurality", value: "set", kind: "fact"} — multi-author
  divergence on a declared set reads as union (joint building), never contest. Read sets
  with recall {all: true}.
- When unsure what something is called, try `topics`/`search` before minting a new entity id;
  if you find a duplicate id for the same thing, assert `same`.
- Your briefing carries an `inbox`: messages other sessions addressed to you. `ack` what you
  handle (with a note saying what you did). To hand off work, ask a question, or leave a
  ruling for another session, `post` it — addressed to a surface, model, topic, or the user —
  instead of writing task beliefs on a project entity. Correspondence is mail; knowledge is
  `remember`.
- Before ending: `end-session` {summary: what happened + what's still open}.
```

## Running it remotely (one node, every surface)

The protocol brain is transport-agnostic; `chorus:http` serves it over **streamable HTTP**
so every Claude surface can share one store on one always-on machine. One `Mcp-Session-Id`
= one chorus session = one author — a surface connecting twice is two keypairs, exactly
like two local processes.

```bash
# On the host (generate the token once, keep it private like the seed):
CHORUS_HTTP_TOKEN=<48 hex chars> CHORUS_MASTER_SEED=... CHORUS_STORE=~/.chorus/memory.jsonl \
  npm run chorus:http     # binds 127.0.0.1:4821 — TLS terminates in front

# Reach it from your other machines (tailnet only):
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /mcp https://+:443 http://127.0.0.1:4821/mcp
claude mcp add chorus --transport http https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp/<token>

# Reach it from claude.ai web (requires PUBLIC reachability — Claude connects from
# Anthropic's servers, not your browser):
tailscale funnel --bg 4821
# then add a custom connector: https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp/<token>
```

Auth, v0: the token is a secret URL path segment, because claude.ai's connector UI offers
OAuth-or-nothing and cannot send custom headers; clients that can send headers may use
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` against `/mcp` instead. Treat the URL as a credential.
Real OAuth (with dynamic client registration) is the planned upgrade if the node ever
serves anyone but its keyholder. Unknown paths 404 without a body.

## MX: parity with native memory, and past it

Native Claude memory = an always-loaded index + free-text files. The Chorus equivalents:

- **Index → `briefing`**: same role as MEMORY.md, but computed, salience-ranked, and honest —
  it includes what the record _disagrees about_ (`contested`) instead of silently keeping the
  last edit.
- **Write a file → `remember`/`revise`**: same friction, but every write is signed, kinded,
  and attributable.
- What native memory cannot do at all: **receipts on every read** (`explain`: which model, in
  which session, said this), **time travel** (`as-of`), **retroactive session distrust**
  (standing trust edits rehydrate into every future session's lens), and **append-only
  revision** (`revise` keeps the old fact queryable forever).

## Naming (why there is no DNS here)

Canonical ids for domain objects are a _judgment problem_, not an infrastructure problem.
Chorus's position, inherited from the substrate:

- **Ids are cheap, local, and namespaced by convention** (`person:mike`, `svc:api`,
  `topic:rhizomatic`). Minting requires no coordination.
- **Convergence is asserted, not assigned.** When two sessions mint `person:mike` and
  `user:mbilokonsky` for the same human, the repair is a _sameAs claim_ — signed, negatable,
  confidence-scored, exactly like the librarian's vocabulary mappings (SPEC-9). Recall reads
  through the equivalence closure under YOUR trust policy.
- **A registrar is just an author.** A "DNS-like service" in this architecture is a well-known
  keypair whose naming claims you choose to rank highly — naming as policy, not as a central
  service. Two fleets can trust different registrars and still federate; disputes are held in
  superposition like any other disagreement.

(The sameAs closure and discovery tools land in the discovery slice — see PROGRESS.md.)

## Status

Tracked in [PROGRESS.md](../../PROGRESS.md) ("MX arc"). The full MX arc is landed — identity
(interval introductions), the shared store, discovery, the briefing, decide/replay, the
console — and the system has survived first contact with live dogfooding (which produced the
reference-over-string surface, the unbounded contested scan, and mid-session model
rebinding). Open: scoped briefings (per-topic lenses + curator digests), a real embedding
model behind the librarian, log compaction at scale.
