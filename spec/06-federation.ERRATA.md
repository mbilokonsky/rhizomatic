# ERRATA & Decisions — SPEC-6 (Federation)

## F1 — v0 federation is in-process; transport is out of scope by design

A v0 **Peer** is a Reactor plus a signing keypair, an **offered lens**, and an **admission
predicate**. Sync exchanges the spec's abstract messages as plain data between in-process peers —
which is a legitimate transport (§2 blesses sneakernet; a function call clears that bar). HTTP/WS
bindings are future work (§9).

## F2 — v0 reconciliation: full sorted-id exchange

WANT carries the requester's full sorted id list; the responder offers `eval(lens, log)` minus
those ids. Correct and convergent, not yet sublinear — the Merkle/IBLT set-digest construction is
SPEC-6 §9's open question and is deferred. The D10 set digest serves SUMMARY for change detection.

## F3 — The signature boundary, operationalized

Folded into SPEC-6 §3 (2026-06-11); history in git.

## F4 — Lenses are DSet-sort terms

Folded into SPEC-6 §4 (2026-06-11); history in git.

## F5 — The blessed HTTP binding (v0 wire shape)

One endpoint, one verb (SPEC-6 §9: bless one, leave the rest wild):

```
POST /rhz/v0/sync
  request  (JSON): { "have": [deltaId, ...] }              // the WANT message
  response (JSON): {                                        // the OFFER + BUNDLEs
    "bundles": [ { "manifest": WireDelta, "members": [WireDelta...] } ... ],
    "loose":   [ WireDelta... ]
  }
WireDelta = { "claims": <JSON debug profile>, "sig"?: hex }   // ids recomputed on receipt
```

The responder computes `eval(offeredLens, log)` minus `have`, partitioned exactly per F3.
Wire deltas carry NO id field — the receiver recomputes content addresses through the standard
ingest path (never trust the wire; same rule as packs, ERRATA-8 P2). JSON numbers MUST be
parsed correctly rounded (ERRATA-1, the serde_json float_roundtrip lesson). The full admission
pipeline (verify → admission Pred → ingest) applies unchanged on receipt; pull twice in
opposite directions for anti-entropy. A Rust client against a TS server (and vice versa) is the
queued cross-implementation interop proof.
